# Layout / Geometry Development Plan

## Goal
Build a high-performance, extensible layout and geometry foundation for multiple OPC methods, with complete tests, benchmarks, local Git milestone commits, and reports under `doc/`.

## User Requirements
- Preserve speed: load each layout once, retain hierarchy, query by ROI, batch all Python/native crossings.
- Keep RB-OPC, MB-OPC, ILT, SRAF, and future backends compatible.
- Use compact code formatting with file comments, function docstrings, and comments on critical paths.
- Treat source layouts as immutable and export geometry patches.
- Test a single polygon crossing adjacent core boundaries.
- Commit key milestones locally; never push.

## Phases
| Phase | Status | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Project foundation | complete | Packaging, contracts, planning records, test setup |
| 2. Layout layer | complete | LayoutDB, hierarchy, layers, lazy ROI queries |
| 3. Geometry layer | in_progress | Region operations, contours, edges, validation, local index |
| 4. Patch/output | pending | Ownership clipping, conflicts, GDS/OASIS export |
| 5. Verification | pending | Unit/integration/regression/performance tests |
| 6. Reports | pending | Development and test reports under `doc/` |

## Acceptance Gates
- Existing GDS regression counts and hierarchy transforms are correct.
- Generated hierarchy, multi-layer, path/text, holes, transforms, and boundary cases pass.
- A polygon crossing adjacent core boxes is clipped into complementary patches without loss or overlap.
- Patch GDS/OASIS round trips have XOR area zero.
- New `layout/` and `geometry/` code reaches at least 90% test coverage.
- Million-instance ROI benchmark does not flatten the full hierarchy and stays within agreed limits.
- Git working tree retains unrelated user files and all milestone commits remain local.

## Errors Encountered
| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Earlier Git probe ran before repository existed | 1 | Repository now exists; verify status before every commit |
| Python stdin mangled a Chinese HTML path | 1 | Pass Unicode paths through PowerShell environment variables |
| ROI Region materialized 11 shapes while diagnostics found 10 polygon-like + 1 text | 1 | Set native iterator shape flags to Box/Path/Polygon; avoids Python filtering and fixes count |

## Decisions
- Backend: KLayout 0.30.x C++ Region plus NumPy arrays.
- Source database: immutable; patch-only output in this phase.
- Core geometry units: integer DBU.
- OPC fragmentation remains outside geometry.
- `TestReticle/gcd_45nm.gds` is user-owned and excluded from commits unless explicitly requested.
